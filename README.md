# Swift Color Picker Example
Swift Color Picker Example is a single view application that provides developers an example of how to display a color picker view over the primary view requiring use of such tool. The code is simple and has been implemented in a way that users should be able to review the code and implement in their own projects in their own ways.

# Core Features
## Display Color Picker View
This view contains pixelation set to a default value of thirty. It can be adjusted to smaller or larger as required. Using `UILongPressGestureRecognizer` to detect touches at a `CGPoint` which is mapped to the color at that point. 

### Want change the the pixels?
This is nice and simple! You can change the size here (line 36) in the `ColorPicker.swift` file:

```Swift
@IBInspectable var elementSize: CGFloat = 30.0 {
    didSet {
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
}
```

Adjust the value 30.0 to be smaller or greater. That's it!

I discovered this code at this answer to solve the issue: [Simple swift color picker popover (iOS)](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34142316/4008175) so head over and give some love if my demo app helps.

## Color Brightness Check
If you noticed in the gif, the button changes font and border color. This is thanks to an extension I have used to detect whether the background color is light or dark. 

I discovered this code at this answer to solve the issue: [Check if UIColor is dark or bright?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29044899/4008175)

It returns a boolean which details whether the color is currently light or dark. In my own code I have a simple if statement that returns white or black to set the color of the button text and border.

# Summary
I hope this demo helps, there are a few around but I found this method the most dynamic and easy to implement.
